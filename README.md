# UnityVrGameController
Experimental VR game controllers for ParaParaParadise and DanceManiax using vJoy and Unity.

Requirements:
- Unity 2021.1.17f1
- vJoy (http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/)

You must create a vJoy device with X, Y, RX, RY, and 16 buttons for this to work (untested, going off memory and looking at the code).

My VR headset is broken so I am unable to continue development of this. As such, this is an ABANDONDED project so any requests for assistance will be ignored.
Also, I'm not a Unity dev so the project itself probably sucks.

I tried to clean up a lot of unused resources since it was based on a VR Beginner project. Refer to the the git history for the original project folder.

This has only been tested with an Oculus Rift S headset.
